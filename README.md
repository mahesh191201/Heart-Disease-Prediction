# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction ML model predicts the heart disease for patients based on patient health record.

Heart attacks are rapidly increasing nowadays and its very important to find the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on their medical record. In this way we can identify heart disease at an early stage and give the patient appropriate treatement.
For that purpose, this project utilizes various models to predict the heart disease in a patient.


Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

K-Nearest Neighbours

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost 

Artificial Neural Network 

The highest accuracy achieved was 90% by Naive Bayes classifier and Logistic Regression
